This game requires the player to guess the letters in a country's name. If you get the correct letter, all the instances of that letter in the world will be highlighted and the player gets another chance.

For improvements, I would like to add diferent options for the player. They should be able to select form other categories such as food, cars and/or sports. I would also like to offer a hint to a player by hovering over one part of the website
